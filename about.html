        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My academic journey reflects this passion, marked by a Diploma in Halal Management and culminating in a Degree in Information System Management.
            This educational blend has equipped me with a holistic perspective, merging the nuances of management with the prowess of information systems.
            <p>Beyond the academic sphere, my practical experience has been diverse. From operating systems in various capacities to offering support as a clinic assistant,
                each role honed my foundational IT skills while fostering an environment where adaptability became second nature.</p>
                <p>I've found immense fulfillment in volunteering, where the act of service not only contributes to society but also fuels my inherent drive for self-improvement.
                    This commitment to growth intertwines with my innate leadership skills, cultivated through roles like a school prefect and acknowledged as the best employee within a month at a clinic, where effective communication and problem-solving were paramount.</p>
                    <p>Fluency in languages—Malay, English, and Mandarin—facilitates seamless interactions across diverse settings, underscoring my commitment to effective communication and bridging cultural divides.</p>
                    <p>In essence, I am driven by an unwavering commitment to leveraging technology for holistic solutions, fueled by a relentless pursuit of self-improvement and a fervent dedication to contributing positively to any endeavor I undertake.
                        My journey stands as a testament to the amalgamation of technological prowess, interpersonal finesse, and an unyielding quest for excellence.</p>
